> [!NOTE]  
> **What's New?**
> - Addded `-AlternateInstallMethod` optional parameter to force previous method of installation before use of `Repair-WinGetPackageManager`.

    -   Adjust access rights & PATH environment variable
-   Runs command registration if the WinGet command is not detected at the end of installation

## Setup

### Method 1 - PowerShell Gallery

**This is the recommended method, because it always gets the public release that has been tested, it's easy to remember, and supports all parameters.**

Open PowerShell as Administrator and type

```powershell
Install-Script winget-install -Force
```

Follow the prompts to complete the installation (you can tap `A` to accept all prompts or `Y` to select them individually.

**Note:** `-Force` is optional but recommended, as it will force the script to update if it is outdated. If you do not use `-Force`, it will _not_ overwrite the script if outdated.

#### Usage

```powershell
winget-install
```

If WinGet is already installed, you can use the `-Force` parameter to force the script to run anyway.

The script is published on [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/winget-install) under `winget-install`.

### Method 2 - One Line Command (Runs Immediately)

The URL [asheroto.com/winget](https://asheroto.com/winget) always redirects to the [latest code-signed release](https://github.com/asheroto/winget-install/releases/latest/download/winget-install.ps1) of the script.

If you just need to run the basic script without any parameters, you can use the following one-line command:

#### Option A: asheroto.com short URL

```powershell
irm asheroto.com/winget | iex
```

Due to the nature of how PowerShell works, you won't be able to use any parameters like `-Force` with this command line. You can set the global variable `$Force` to `$true` and the script should pick up on it ([more info](#global-variables)), but if for some reason that doesn't work or you absolutely need to use a one-line command with parameters, you can use the following:

```powershell
&([ScriptBlock]::Create((irm asheroto.com/winget))) -Force
```

#### Option B: WinGet.pro short URL

To make it easier to remember, you can also use the URL [WinGet.pro](https://winget.pro) which redirects to the same URL. This URL is provided courtesy of [Omaha Consulting](https://github.com/omaha-consulting).

```powershell
irm winget.pro | iex
```

Due to the nature of how PowerShell works, you won't be able to use any parameters like `-Force` with this command line. You can set the global variable `$Force` to `$true` and the script should pick up on it ([more info](#global-variables)), but if for some reason that doesn't work or you absolutely need to use a one-line command with parameters, you can use the following:

```powershell
&([ScriptBlock]::Create((irm winget.pro))) -Force
```

#### Option C: direct release URL

Alternatively, you can of course use the latest code-signed release URL directly:

```powershell
irm https://github.com/asheroto/winget-install/releases/latest/download/winget-install.ps1 | iex
```

### Method 3 - Download Locally and Run

As a more conventional approach, download the latest [winget-install.ps1](https://github.com/asheroto/winget-install/releases/latest/download/winget-install.ps1) from [Releases](https://github.com/asheroto/winget-install/releases), then run the script as follows:

```powershell
.\winget-install.ps1
```

You can use the `-Force` or `-ForceClose` parameters if needed, or use `$Force = $true` and `$ForceClose = $true` global session variables if preferred.

> [!TIP]
> If for some reason your PowerShell window closes at the end of the script and you don't want it to, or don't want your other scripts to be interrupted, you can wrap the command in a `powershell "COMMAND HERE"`. For example, `powershell "irm asheroto.com/winget | iex"`.

> [!NOTE]
> On Windows 11 IoT, you may need to run the following command. Unlike other editions that may prompt about Execution Policy, IoT might not:
> `powershell -ep B "irm asheroto.com/winget | iex"`

## Parameters

**No parameters are required** to run the script, but there are some optional parameters to use if needed.

| Parameter                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| `-Force`                  | Ensures the installation of WinGet and its dependencies, even if they are already present.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `-ForceClose`             | If Windows Terminal has trouble installing WinGet, use this parameter to relaunch the script in conhost.exe and automatically end any active processes associated with WinGet that could interfere with the installation.                                     |
| `-AlternateInstallMethod` | Alternate installation method if primary installation method fails.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `-CheckForUpdate`         | Checks if there is an update available for the script.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `-Wait`                   | By default, the script exits immediately after completion. Although this is not supposed to close the PowerShell window, sometimes it still occurs. Use this parameter to pause the script for several seconds before exiting to observe the output.          |

```

## Global Variables

Global variables are _optional_ and are only needed if you don't want to use parameters. They can be set before running the script, or you can set them in your PowerShell profile to always use them.

| Variable      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `$Debug`      | Enables debug mode, which shows additional information for debugging.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `$Force`      | Ensures installation of WinGet and its dependencies, even if already present.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `$ForceClose` | Windows Terminal sometimes has trouble installing WinGet; run the script with the -ForceClose parameter to relaunch the script in conhost.exe and automatically end active processes associated with WinGet that could interfere with the installation |

### Example Global Variables Usage

```powershell
$Force = $true
winget-install
```

## Troubleshooting

-   Before releasing a new version, the script is tested on a clean install of Windows 10, Server 2022, and Windows 11.
-   If you run into an issue, please ensure your system is compatible & fully updated.
-   Sometimes PowerShell closes the window before you can read the output. To prevent this, you can use the `-Wait` parameter to pause the script for a few seconds or the `-NoExit` parameter to keep the window open indefinitely. Improving script exit functionality is on our TODO list.
-   Try running `winget-install` again, sometimes the script will fail due to a temporary issue with the prerequisite server URLs.
-   Try using the `-Debug` parameters to see if it provides any additional information.
-   If winget is unable to run at some point in the future, or if you suspect an issue with the PATH environment variable, run the script again with the `-Force` parameter.
-   If you're getting a `resource in use` error message, run the script again with the `-ForceClose` parameter.
-   Try [installing WinGet manually](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/#install-winget-on-windows-sandbox) to see if the issue exists with WinGet itself.
-   If the issue occurs when installing WinGet manually, please open an [issue on the WinGet-cli repo](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/issues) (unrelated to this script).
-   Check the [WinGet-cli Troubleshooting Guide](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/blob/master/doc/troubleshooting/README.md).
-   If the problem **only** occurs when using this script, please open an issue here.
